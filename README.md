# complaints-backend
A backend to store complaints in a mongodb database.

## Backend Engineer Challenge

### Problem

We need to research about locales where consumer complains are made. That complains should have at least the attributes described bellow:

 - Title
 - Description
 - Locale
 - Company

Can you provide some services to ingest complains and get some data about its geolocation? For example, to find how many complains a specific company has in specific city?
